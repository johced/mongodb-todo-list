4. npm start

## Comments

Basic NoSQL(mongoDB), Nodejs, Filestructure, Express, Routing, Template Engine (ejs).
Focus on database, not ejs. Error handeling is only for the app to work. The task is not to master ejs, we will focus on React later on.

I have a simple pagination and sort function. Required is at min/2 max/34 for letters.

I could of made a service folder and a render.js file, compromised/refactored at least two of my controller functions. But I think in this small project, it works well.
